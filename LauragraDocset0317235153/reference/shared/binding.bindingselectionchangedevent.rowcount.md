# BindingSelectionChangedEventArgs.rowCount property
Gets the number of rows selected.

|:-----|:-----|
|**Hosts:**|Access, Excel, Word|
|**Last changed in**|1.1|

```
var rwCount = eventArgsObj.rowCount;
```


## Return value

The number of rows selected. If a single cell is selected returns 1.


## Remarks

If the user makes a non-contiguous selection, the count for the last contiguous selection within the binding is returned. 

For Word, this property will work only for bindings of [BindingType](../../reference/shared/bindingtype-enumeration.md) "table". If the binding is of type "matrix", **null** is returned. Also, the call will fail if the table contains merged cells, because the structure of the table must be uniform for this property to work correctly.


## Example

The following example adds an event handler for the [SelectionChanged](../../reference/shared/binding.bindingselectionchangedevent.md) event to the binding with an [id](../../reference/shared/binding.id.md) of `myTable`. When the user changes the selection, the handler displays the coordinates of the first cell in the selection, and the number of row and columns selected.


```js
function addSelectionHandler() {
    Office.context.document.bindings.getByIdAsync("myTable", function (result) {
        result.value.addHandlerAsync("bindingSelectionChanged", myHandler);
    });
}

// Display selection start coordinates and row/column count.
function myHandler(bArgs) {
    write("Selection start row/col: " + bArgs.startRow + "," + bArgs.startColumn);
    write("Selection row count: " + bArgs.rowCount);
    write("Selection col count: " + bArgs.columnCount);
}
// Function that writes to a div with id='message' on the page.
function write(message){
    document.getElementById('message').innerText += message; 
}
```
