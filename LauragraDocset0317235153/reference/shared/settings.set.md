```js
Office.context.document.settings.set(name, value);
```


## Parameters



_name_<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:  **string**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case-sensitive name of the setting to set or create.

    
_value_<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type:  **string**,  **number**,  **boolean**,  **null**,  **object** or **array**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the value to be stored.
    

## Remarks

The  **set** method creates a new setting of the specified name if it does not already exist, or sets an existing setting of the specified name in the in-memory copy of the settings property bag. After you call the [Settings.saveAsync](../../reference/shared/settings.saveasync.md) method, the value is stored in the document as the serialized JSON representation of its data type. A maximum of 2MB is available for the settings of each add-in.


 >**Important**:  Be aware that the  **Settings.set** method affects only the in-memory copy of the settings property bag. To make sure that additions or changes to settings will be available to your add-in the next time the document is opened, at some point after calling the **Settings.set** method and before the add-in is closed, you must call the **Settings.saveAsync** method to persist settings in the document.


## Example




```js
function setMySetting() {
    Office.context.document.settings.set('mySetting', 'mySetting value');
}

```
