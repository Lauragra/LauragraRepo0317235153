## Remarks

The settings created by using the methods of the  **Settings** object are saved per add-in and per document. That is, they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.

The name of a setting is a  **string**, while the value can be a  **string**,  **number**,  **boolean**,  **null**,  **object**, or  **array**.

The  **Settings** object is automatically loaded as part of the [Document](../../reference/shared/document.md) object, and is available by calling the [settings](../../reference/shared/document.settings.md) property of that object when the add-in is activated. The developer is responsible for calling the [saveAsync](../../reference/shared/settings.saveasync.md) method after adding or deleting settings to save the settings in the document.
