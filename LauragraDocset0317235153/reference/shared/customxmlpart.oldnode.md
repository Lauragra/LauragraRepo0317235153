## Return Value

A [CustomXmlNode](../../reference/shared/customxmlnode.customxmlnode.md) that represents the node that was just deleted.


## Remarks

Note that this node may have children, if a subtree is being removed from the document. Also, this node will be a "disconnected" node in that you can query down from the node, but you cannot query up the tree - the node appears to exist alone.
