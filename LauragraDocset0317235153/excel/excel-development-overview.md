# Excel Development

You can create an integration with Excel by using either Microsoft Graph or the Office Add-ins platform. Each of these integration options facilitates a particular type of scenario.

## Access Excel data with Microsoft Graph

[Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) enables you to read and modify Excel workbooks that are stored in OneDrive, SharePoint, or other supported storage platforms. By issuing REST API requests to Microsoft Graph, your app can access Excel objects such as workbooks, worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, named items, and more. To learn more about using Microsoft Graph to access data in Excel, see [Working with Excel in Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/excel).

## Extend Excel functionality with Office Add-ins

The [Office Add-ins platform](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins) enables you to create an app that runs within the context of Excel, extending Excel functionality and/or adding content to the workbook where it is running. An Excel Add-in can extend Excel functionality by adding custom ribbon buttons or menu commands, inserting task panes, or opening dialog boxes, and can even embed rich, web-based objects such as charts or interactive visualizations within a document. By using Office.js (the JavaScript API for Office), your add-in can interact with the data in the workbook where it is running, including worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, named items, and more. To learn more about creating an Excel Add-in, see [Excel add-ins overview](excel-add-ins-overview.md).
