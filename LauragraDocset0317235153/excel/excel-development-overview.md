# Excel Development

Both Microsoft Graph and the Office Add-ins platform enable you to integrate with Excel. Which form of integration you choose will depend upon your specific use case and the objectives of your application.

## Access Excel data with Microsoft Graph

[Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) enables you to read and modify Excel workbooks that are stored in OneDrive, SharePoint, or other supported storage platforms. By issuing REST API requests to Microsoft Graph, your app can access Excel objects such as workbooks, worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, named items, and more. To learn more about using Microsoft Graph to access data in Excel, see [Working with Excel in Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/excel).

## Extend Excel functionality with Office Add-ins

The [Office Add-ins platform](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins) enables you to extend Excel functionality by creating an app that runs in Excel. An Excel add-in can add custom ribbon buttons or menu commands, insert task panes, open dialog boxes, and even embed rich, web-based objects such as charts or interactive visualizations within a worksheet. An add-in uses Office.js (the JavaScript API for Office) to interact with objects in the workbook where it is running, including worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, named items, and more. To learn more about creating an Excel add-in, see [Excel add-ins overview](excel-add-ins-overview.md).
