# Dropdown Component in Office UI Fabric

A Dropdown is a list in which reveals selected items by clicking a drop-down button. It is used to simplify the design and make a choice within the UI. The selected item is visible when the list is collapse. To change the value, users open the list, navigate through the list and select a new value.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb on a task pane

        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
