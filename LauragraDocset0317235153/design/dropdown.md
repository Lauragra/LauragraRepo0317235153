# Dropdown Component in Office UI Fabric

A Dropdown is a list in which reveals selected items by clicking a drop-down button. It is used to simplify the design and make a choice within the UI. The selected item is visible when the list is collapse. To change the value, users open the list, navigate through the list and select a new value.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb on a task pane

## Best Practices

img 
* Do - Use a Dropdown when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained. 
* Don't - Don’t use Dropdown if there’s less than 2 choices.

img 
* Do - Dropdowns contain shortened statements or words.
* Don't - Don’t use lengthy words.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Do</th>
        <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Use a Dropdown when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Variants

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Variation</th>
