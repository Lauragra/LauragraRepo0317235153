# ChoiceGroup Component in Office UI Fabric

A Checkbox is a UI element that allows users to select or deselect actions items in add-in. It is used to switch between two mutually exclusive options through a single click and to indicate a subordinate setting or preference when paired with another control.

The control has two selection states: unselected and selected.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb on a task pane
