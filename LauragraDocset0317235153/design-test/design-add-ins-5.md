# Design your Office Add-ins

Office Add-ins extend the Office experience by providing contextual functionality that users can access within Office clients. Add-ins empower users to get more done by enabling them to access third-party functionality within Office, without costly context switches. 

 Your add-in UX design must integrate seamlessly with Office to provide an efficient, natural interaction for your users. Take advantage of add-in commands (Office UI extensions) to provide access to your add-in and use the [UI elements](ui-elements/ui-elements.md) and [best practices](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/add-in-development-best-practices) that we recommend when you create custom HTML-based UI. 
 
 
## Add-in building blocks
You can use two types of UI elements to create your add-ins: 

- [Add-in commands](ui-elements/ui-elements.md#add-in-commands) enable you to add native UX hooks into Office applications.
- [Custom HTML-based UI](ui-elements/ui-elements.md#custom-html-based-ui) allows you to take advantage of the power of HTML within Office clients. 

For details about how to use these building blocks, see [Choose your Office UI extension point]().  

## UX design patterns

To help you create a first-class user experience for your add-in, we provide templates that illustrate common UX design patterns. These templates reflect [best practices](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/add-in-development-best-practices) for creating compelling, world-class add-ins, and include patterns for first-run experiences, branding elements, and user notifications. They use [Office UI Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric) components and styles and include elements that naturally extend the Office UI.

To access the templates, see the [Office Add-in UX Design Patterns](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns) repo. The Adobe Illustrator files are also available; you can download and update them to reflect your own designs. You can also copy the code files from the [Office Add-in UX design patterns code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code) repo to your add-in project and customize them as needed. 

## Recommended layouts
We provide recommended layouts for each add-in type, along with **end-to-end** examples to help you put everything together. To learn more about how to lay out your add-in, see the following:
