# Toggle Component in Office UI Fabric

In add-ins, Toggles represent a physical switch to turn things on or off. Use Toggles to present two mutually exclusive options (e.g. on/off), where choosing an option results in an immediate action.
  
#### Example: Toggle on a task pane

## Best Practices

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:------------|:--------------|
|Use a Toggle for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them.|Donâ€™t use a Toggle if it requires users to perform an extra step for changes to take effect.|
|![Do Toggle example](../images/toggleDo.png)|![Don't Toggle example](../images/toggleDont.png)|

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:------------|:--------------|
|Only replace the On and Off labels if there are more specific labels for the setting. If there are short (3-4 characters) labels that represent binary opposites that are more appropriate for a particular setting, use them.| |

## Variants

|**Variation**|**Description**|**Example**|
|:------------|:--------------|:----------|
|**Enabled and checked**|Use when toggled state is active.|![Enabled and checked image](../images/toggleEnabledOn.png)|
