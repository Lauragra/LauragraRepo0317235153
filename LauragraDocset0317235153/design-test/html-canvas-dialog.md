# HTML Canvases â€“ Dialog
 
Dialogs are surfaces that float above the active Office application window. Dialogs allow you to provide additional screen space for tasks such as sign-in pages that cannot be opened directly in a task pane, confirming an action taken by a user that could potentially destroy document data, and host videos that may be too small if confined to a task pane for example.
