Office Add-ins are composed of two main interface elements: Add-in Commands and HTML Canvases. Commands and canvases look familiar inside of Office. They fit alongside Office UI while giving you the flexibility to create highly customized solutions. They work across platforms and update with versions. Add-in commands have two extension points. HTML Canvases have three.

* __Add-in Commands__ - Start actions in your add-in such as running JavaScript code or launching HTML containers.
** __Ribbon Tabs & Commands__ - Show customers where to find and use your add-in by extending the Office Ribbon. Initiate actions from the commands you create and organize as new ribbon tabs or add to existing tabs.
** __Context Menus__ - Surface your add-in functionality on specific objects inside of Office documents. Initiate actions from commands you create and organize as new menu items in the Office context (right-click) menu.
* __HTML Containers__ - Embed custom HTML-based UI within Office clients.
** __Task Pane__ - Display custom UI in the right pane of the Office document when usage requires interaction between page, worksheet, slide and your add-in.
** __Content__ - Display custom UI directly within Office documents when your add-in is meant to be a part of the page, worksheet or slide.
** __Dialog__ - Display custom UI in a dialog on top of Office when usage should be focused and does not require interaction with the page, worksheet or slide.
