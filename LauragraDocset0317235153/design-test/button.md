# Button component in Office UI Fabric

Use buttons in your Office Add-in to enable a user to commit a change or complete steps in a task. Make sure that the text of the button communicates the intent of the interaction. Place buttons at the bottom of the UI container of a task pane, dialog box, or content pane.

For example, use buttons for the user to submit a form, to close a dialog box, or to move to the next settings screen to commit changes.
  
**Example: Buttons on a task pane**

## Best Practices

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:-----|:--------|
|Default buttons should always perform safe operations in add-ins.|Don’t place the default focus on a button that destroys data. Instead, place it on the button that performs the “safe act” and retains the content or cancels the action.|
|![Do Button example](../images/buttonDo.png)|![Don't Button example](../images/buttonDont.png)|

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:-----|:--------|
|Use only a single line of text in the label of the button.|Don’t put too much text in a button – try keep text to a minimum.|
|Make sure the label conveys a clear purpose of the button to the user. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels, usually a single word.|Don’t use a button to navigate to another place apart from “Back” and “Next” buttons, use a link instead.|
|Expose only one or two buttons to the user at a time. For example, “Accept” and “Cancel”. If you need to expose more actions to the user, consider using checkboxes or radio buttons from which the user can select actions, with a single command button to trigger those actions.|Don’t put anything other than text in a button.|
|“Submit”, “OK”, and “Apply” buttons should always be styled as primary buttons. When “Reset” or “Cancel” buttons appear alongside one of the above, they should be styled as default buttons.| |

## Variants

|**Variation**|**Description**|**Example**|
|:------------|:--------------|:----------|
|**Primary Button**|Inherits theme color at rest state. Use this as the main call to action.|![Primary Button image](../images/button_primary.png)|
|**Default Button**|Default button should always perform safe operations and should never delete.|![Default Button image](../images/button_default.png)|
|**Compound Button**|Used to cause actions that complete a task or cause a transitional task.|![Compound Button image](../images/button_compound.png)|
