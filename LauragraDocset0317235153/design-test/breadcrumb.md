# Breadcrumb Component in Office UI Fabric

In add-ins, breadcrumbs are used as a navigational aid. They indicate the current page’s location within a hierarchy and help the user understand where they are in relation to the rest of that hierarchy. They also afford one-click access to higher hierarchy levels.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb on a task pane
