# Design your Office Add-ins

Office Add-ins extend the Office experience by providing contextual functionality that users can access within Office clients. Add-ins empower users to get more done by enabling them to access third-party functionality within Office, without costly context switches. 

 Your add-in UX design must integrate seamlessly with Office to provide an efficient, natural interaction for your users. Take advantage of [add-in commands](add-in-commands.md) to provide access to your add-in and apply the best practices that we recommend when you create custom HTML-based UI. 
 
## Office Add-in design principles
Regardless of the underlying framework you use to create your custom UI, apply the following principles as you design your add-in: 

- **Design explicitly for Office**. The functionality and look and feel of an add-in must harmoniously complement the Office experience, including applying the the Office or document theme.
 
- **Make users more efficient**. Help users get one job done without getting in the way of other jobs. Allow for seamless interaction between Office documents and your add-in. 

- **Favor content over chrome**. Emphasize the add-in's content and functionality over any accessory chrome. Maximize the use of space by avoiding superfluous UI elements that don't add value to the user experience.  

- **Keep users in control**. Allow users to control their experience, understand any important decisions, and easily reverse actions the add-in performs. 

- **Design for all platforms and input methods**. Add-ins are designed to work on all the platforms that Office supports, and your add-in UX should be optimized to work across platforms and form factors. Support mouse/keyboard and touch input devices, and ensure that your custom HTML UI is responsive to adapt to different form factors.
