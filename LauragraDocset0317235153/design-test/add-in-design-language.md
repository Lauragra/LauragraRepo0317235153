# Office Add-in design language

We recommend that you adopt the Office design language and use [Office UI Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric) to create custom HTML-based experiences in your add-ins. If your organization already has a design language, you're welcome to use it, as long as the end result is a harmonious experience for Office users.
